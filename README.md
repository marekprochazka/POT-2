# Progressive overload tracker vol2

- Resurrection of a long-forgotten project that was to serve as a helper in keeping track of progressive overload in
  training especially in a gym.

## POT-1

- https://github.com/marekprochazka/POT-project
- Backend: DJR
- Frontend: Vue3 with typescript support
- Project was abandoned due to other priorities in life
- Now that I have time to work on this project again I've decided to start from scratch because I'm now once again a
  more experienced programmer, and I would like to make many things differently than in version one
