# Progressive overload tracker vol2

- Ressurection of a long-forgotten project that was to serve as a helper in keeping track of progressive overload in training especially in a gym.

## POT-1
- https://github.com/marekprochazka/POT-project
- Backend: DJR
- Forntend: Vue3 with typescript support 
- Project was abandoned due to other priorities in life 
- Now that I have time to work on this project again I've decided to start from scratch because I'm now once again a more experienced programmer and I would like to make many things differently than in version one
